# LightsOut

This project displays a game board where the user must change all spaces to black. When clicking a space, all adjacent spaces change color. Users have the option to view an "about" page, which provides simple instructions of play and author information, start a new game, or exit the app. Upon completion of the game, users are presented with a window which tells them they've won.
